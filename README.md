# Title: Europe travel Agency

The website represents the online presence of a travel company in UK, which offers a variety of vacation packages around Europe.

 
## UX
 
The website is designed as a one page layout, a modern aproach used oftnen nowadays. 
As you open the website, you'll feel relaxed and welcomed by the background video wich covers the entire page at all time. The inspiration to create a travel website came from the CodeInstitute sugestions and it was a great idea to take on.
A google map section is available to user to see exactly the destinations offered as a vacation package with small descriptions of each location.


## Features

Each section of the page has been designed to be easy to read and navigate.
A scroll up button is visible in the rigt corner to help users get back to the top easily.
All the information provided in the packages and destinations sections is to help the user get to a decision and choose which destination they want.

At the top, the first section is dedicated to welcoming the users and get a feeling of the website.
A simple welcoming title and a button which sends the user directly to the destinations section.

The Packages section shows the vacation packages that the company has to offer and the price for each individual package. 

The About section has a short presentation or the company's profile.

The last section is the "Contact" page, which has the form that any potential client can fill in and submit for any supplementary information. 




## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript 
- Bootstrap 4 CDN library (https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
   - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.



## Testing

I have tested each section to see if it loads correctly all the elements and if it looks good on all devices. 

All the links provided are ok and send the user to the specific destination.

The navigation menu has no problems and on smaller screens it transform in a 3-bar icon with a drop menu.  

The types of text used across the website are clear and readable on all types of screens (small or large). 

I have used the Markup Validation Service (https://validator.w3.org/) and the CSS Validation Service (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and both return no errors on the written code.

## Bugs

I noticed that the Google map doesn't load correctly. This may be because I have used the API key provided in the course. I have tried to create my own API key, followed all the steps but in the end I gave up because Google kept saying it cannot retrieve the client ID.


## Deployment

This project has been created using Gitpod and stored Github pages and deployed by creating a unique link in Github, following the instructions provided.
